            pioneering a revolutionary understanding of the nature of
            consciousness <br />
            ...striving to discover who we are beyond our thoughts, emotions,
            memories, associations, and perceptions… <br />
            Samadhi is said to be a fourth kind of consciousness: <br />
            It is beyond the states of waking, dreaming and dreamless sleep.
            <br />
            Those who have witnessed it as an external phenomenon report that
            the experience appeared to have fallen into a kind of trance.
            <br />
            The hair on the head and body stood erect. The half-closed eyes
            became fixed. Sometimes there was an astonishing loss of weight, or
            even levitation of the body from the ground. <br />
            But these are mere symptoms, and tell us nothing.. There is only one
            way to find out what samadhi is like: You must have it yourself…
